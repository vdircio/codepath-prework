## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Implementing javascript into the program was something I think I wouldn't have been able to do any time soon. Although daunting and new, CodePath explained how to implement the file well - with experience in Java, JavaScript wasn't so off and the syntax was similar. What was challenging was recording the gif due to not reading the instructions well enough - in computer science, reading is major part of it. Also, there having to do something specific for each part of the pre-flight was, to say the least, intimidating but also exciting knowing I could complete such grand thing. As stated earlier, I did have experience with HTML and CSS so the pre-flight wasn't impossible. When I was learning simple web-development, hitting each argument within the CSS sections was confusing and overwhelming - it is important to check everything that you can (ex. padding, margin, height, width, text-decoration, etc.). The internet will always be the greatest source when coding - looking at other people's code and documentation helped me out and will help me in the future.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Not really a question, but I am interested in learning more about animation within websites and making objects seem smoother with transitionings. I am, also, new to this, and I am curious to see what can be done with web development. I want to learn how to implement data within webs and how to access it.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
There is a lot more, I feel, that can be added to any website. Making the "You Lost." or "You Won." text boxes more appelable appealable would be a start. Custom timings between button play-back sounds (and the sounds themselves) would also be something I could'vce added - it would create a sense of real music not just robotic sounds.
